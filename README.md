# AM Radio Transmitter
This was the final project done for Electronics I by Christian Cipolletta and Thomas Rasa. It is a radio transmitter that will broadcast in the AM band. It uses a Gilbert cell circuit for the mixer, a differential amplifier to combine and strengthen the signal, and an antenna to broadcast it. There is also an MSP430FR2355 Launchpad evaluation board that adds the functionality of changing the tone being broadcast.
